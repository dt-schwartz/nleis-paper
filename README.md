TODO: COMPLETE THIS SECTION

[This repository](https://github.com/mdmurbach/nleis-battery-manuscript) contains all of the data, code, and figures, used in the manuscript. To cite this repository: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/xxxxx.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/xxx)

**Please cite the following paper if you use this code:**

[M. D. Murbach\*, V. W. Hu\*, and D. T. Schwartz. Nonlinear electrochemical impedance spectroscopy for lithium-ion batteries.]()

---------------------------
#### Software dependencies
---------------------------

The code in this repository has been tested with the following versions of software:

- Python 3.6.3 [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)
- Conda 4.3.30 (through Miniconda 3) [https://conda.io/miniconda.html](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
- Git Bash on Windows

The environment.yml file can be used to recreate the same Conda environment with the following commands:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

`source activate nleis-manuscript`

----------
#### Data
----------

The data file is broken up between the experimental data (found in the "raw" folder) and simulation data (found in the "simulation" folder). The experimental data is further broken down into:

- new: contains the the raw data files and the corresponding Kramers-Kronig validation for the EIS/NLEIS experiments done on three fresh Li|NMC cells. Each cell subdirectory has experimental data for 10, 30, 40, 50, and 60% state of charge and the open-circuit potentials the experiments were done at.
- aged: contains the the raw data files and the corresponding Kramers-Kronig validation for the EIS/NLEIS experiments done on three Li|NMC cells cells that were aged for 100 cycles at 2C. Each cell subdirectory has experimental data for 10, 30, 40, 50, and 60% state of charge and the open-circuit potentials the experiments were done at.
- resistor: contains the raw data files for the EIS/NLEIS experiment done of the purely resistive wire to obtain inherent instrument offset


All of the raw data files are stored with Zenodo: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/xxxxx.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/xxx)

To reproduce the figures: Download and unzip the folder from Zenodo into the main repository directory.

#### Folders
---------------

**figures:**  This folder is where the figures generated by the Python code are located.

**jupyter:**  This folder contains the Jupyter notebook (Supplementary Notebook.ipynb) and utility module that are used to compile the dataset, perform any analysis, and generate the manuscript figures.

**data:** This folder will need to be added once the repo has been cloned. For minimal changes to the supplementary notebook, put all data downloaded through the OSF page here.
